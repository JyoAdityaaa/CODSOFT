This repository contains three Python mini-projects completed during the CODSOFT AI Internship.
Each task focuses on beginner-friendly AI concepts and Python logic implementation.

📁 Project Structure
├── Task1_CollegeChatbot/      # Rule-based chatbot using JSON data
├── Task2_TicTacToe/           # CLI Tic-Tac-Toe game
└── Task3_MovieRecommender/    # Simple CSV-based movie recommendation script

🔹 Task 1 — College Information Chatbot

A simple rule-based chatbot that answers college-related questions using predefined responses from a JSON file.

Highlights

Keyword-based rule matching

Loads data from college_info.json

Direct console interaction

No ML or NLP — purely rule-based logic

python Task1_CollegeChatbot/app.py

🔹 Task 2 — Tic-Tac-Toe (Terminal Game)

A terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Python.

Highlights

3×3 game board

Turn switching (X and O)

Move validation

Win and draw detection

Fully interactive CLI program

Run
python Task2_TicTacToe/tictactoe.py

🔹 Task 3 — Simple Movie Recommender

A basic movie recommendation program that suggests similar movies using simple matching logic from CSV files.

Highlights

Reads movie data from CSV

Recommends movies based on title matching or simple criteria

Beginner-level logic (no machine learning/NLP)

Lightweight and easy to understand

Run
python Task3_MovieRecommender/app.py

⚙️ Requirements

Python 3.8 or above

pip install -r Task3_MovieRecommender/requirements.txt (only if your script uses any external libraries)
